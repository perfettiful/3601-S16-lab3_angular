#Lab Tasks

After you have cloned the project and set it up as specified in the Readme, complete the following tasks, answering any
questions by editing this file. 

## Part #1: exploring the project.

- Try adding new pets on the index page through the form. Try deleting entries. Observe the results. 

> Protip: You'll need to start up the server before you can play with the website.

- Click links on the navigation bar. See what happens. Note that when you move away from the page with pets, your changes to the list of pets are lost. This is because we are not storing the array in a database (this will be a part of the next lab). 
- Observe the HTML element's formatting (it's done via bootstrap). As you are working on the questions below, experiment with the project to get a better sense for what each element is. 

##### List all the files at the top level of your project (i.e. not in public) and briefly state the purpose of each one, as you understand it. You might want to postpone describing some files until you work with the project a bit more. 
>1. bower_comonents: angular, bootstrap, and jquery folders
>2. coverage: holds tha PhantomJS testing and javascript controllers
>3. node_modules: server side testing, karma and jasmine

##### List the folders in the public folder and describe the purpose for each.
>1. assets: images for kittens webpage
>2. css: just main css for webpage.
>3. javascript: client side js and controllers.
>4. views:different html pages for this site

##### What are the names of the Angular controllers in this web application? What does each of them do?
>1.main.controller.js: sets default fields for the list at the bottom of kittens page, as well as adding and removing list items, and the total items in list.
>2. navbar.controller.js: manages navbar hyperlinks

##### Open the index.html view. What controller(s) is it using?
 index uses the navbar controller named mainCtrl and uses the main controller in the form ng-submit

##### Where is the navigation bar included in the source code for index.html? 
>It's in a div tag under ng-include.

##### app.js within public/javascript is where your Angular modules are located at. What modules does the project currently have?
>stdControllers
>mainApp

##### Notice, the code controlling the Node.js server is in a file also called app.js. There is no particular reason for this other than a generator we will use later on follows the same convention. Explain the difference between the purpose of the files (think client vs server).
>The app.js on the server side sends and recieves files and data to and from the host. The app.js on the client side manages angular controllers

##### Add a pet to the array, data (in the appropriate controller). See the change on the web page (you need to reload, but not restart).
>added "lizard"

##### How are new items added and deleted through the web page?
(i.e. - What functions from the main controller are used in index.html, and what Angular directives allow them to interact with the view?)
> app.js is managing the controllers being run bu node and thus when a controller is modified, this will be done in real time if the server is running

> The mainCtrl function is determining the default list of elements in the list with mainControl.data, adding filed with mainControl.addData()
> removing with mainControl.removeData(), and item listing with itemsInList()

> The Angular directive utilized are ng-app, ng-include, ng-submit, ng-model, ng-click and ng-repeat

##### Open navbar.html view. What is its purpose? How would you go about adding links to the navigation bar?
> navbar.html seems to be the code for rendering the navbar for index.html but exported. We would modify navbar.pages
> to hyperlink to a new /extension that we could make.

##### Find two instances of use of bootstrap (see above) in either navbar view or index view or both; explain what is formatted.
>1."btn btn-primary" styles the submission button for our list
>2. "nav nav-pills" provides CSS formatting for navbar
>Protip: Bootstrap is awesome. Start using it. Seriously. This allows you to do fancy things with styling (CSS) with very little effort. Think back to lab 1. http://getbootstrap.com/components/ <- Regular Bootstrap. https://angular-ui.github.io/bootstrap/ <- Angular Bootstrap. These offer separate functionality and both can be used simultaneously.

##### Stop the server by pressing Ctrl-C in the terminal, type "grunt test" to run tests. Where are the tests located?
> The tests are located in two places, clientJavascript.spec.js and main.controller.spec.js with a total of 8 tests

## Part #2: modifying the project.

- Set up Travis CI and add the build status icon to your project's README.
  - This should have been done as part of the setup.

>Passing build can be found [here](https://travis-ci.org/perfettiful/3601-S16-lab3_angular)

- Currently clicking on "kittens" returns the "page under construction" message. Using the view about.html as a sample,
  add a page that has a navigation bar. Add an image of your choice to the page (be aware of copyright rules) and a div
  that describes the image.

>Added kitty pic and centered div text

- Explore bootstrap by changing formatting of the page (for instance, position of the image and text). It doesn't have
to look "nice", just different from what it currently is.

>Changed button color, glyph to X icon, and counter to badge

## Part #3: components, controllers, and modules, oh my!

>Protip: You can blame Jacob for the cheesy part name.

- Your first task here is to create a new Angular module that acts as a container for Angular component controllers. To
 do this, look at javascript/app.js. Similar to `stdControllers`, create a module named `stdComponents`, and inject that
  into the `mainApp` module.

- Now that we have an Angular module for containing Angular controllers of components, we want to add the controller for
 our Angular component to the new module. As such, go to `navbar.controller.js` and change the module it is a part of to
  the new `stdComponents` module.

- Boom! You're done making your own module. To make sure Angular is still working, serve the application (using Grunt),
 and make sure you can still use the navbar on the index.html and about.html pages.

- Now, we are going to go a bit more in depth into this. Using navbar as an example, we want you to make another
component. This component will be a `footer` that you will add to your index.html and about.html pages.

- To do this, you need to create: `footer.controller.js`, `footer.html`.

>Protip: Make sure these are added to Git before you commit!

- You need to modify: `index.html`, `about.html`.
- Some general advice:
  - Add the footer controller to the newly created `stdComponents` Angular module.
  - Make sure to include the javascript for the Angular controller in the web pages the components will be a part of.
   DO NOT put the script tag to include this into `footer.html`.

  - Put the footer at the bottom of the pages. Please.

  - If you get confused, look at the respective files that navbar uses. You should be able to mirror this _very_ closely
   after those files.
  - We don't really care what the content of your footer is. It should definitely consist of a footer element.

>Protip: From w3schools... A footer element typically contains: authorship information, copyright information, contact
information, sitemap, back to top links, related documents.


## Part #4: adding the GPA calculator, redux.
- Your goal is to add a page with a form that allows a student to add their courses (course name, number of credits, and
 letter grade) and displays their GPA. The GPA changes as courses are added or removed. As before, letter grades are A,
  B, C, D, and F only.

- The controller for the GPA needs to be added to main.controller.js. Think of what needs to be in its scope.

- Add the necessary view, include the navbar into it, and then add the GPA calculator. Add one feature at a time, make
sure everything is working as it should.

- As before, use TDD for all the helper functions (you may reuse the tests from the previous lab). Now they will all be
 located in public (client-side). No need to modify karma files since it's already testing client-side javascript.

- Use different color for displaying the GPA, depending on whether it is below 2.0, between 2.0 and 3.0, and 3.0 and
above. Use your own CSS or bootstrap.
- Perform simple data validation (add the corresponding function to the controller) so that invalid entries (invalid
grades or wrong number of credits) are not added to the model. An error message needs to be displayed to the user).


##### When you're done with the lab, take a look at your test coverage report and make a note here about what pieces of
 code are covered well, what isn't, and why this is the case.
